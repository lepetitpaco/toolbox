            <p class="lead">Here, you probably won't find what you need right now, but I offer you other stuff you won't
                need. My collection of tools is vast and varied, and I am sure you'll find something that you don't
                need. <br>My tools are designed to be a pain in the ass and complicated to use, even if you need them.

            <p>Explore my subfolders to find the tools that you don't need. We hope you find my website useless.</p>
